The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskvá bridge and the officer ran out into the square.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; he asked, but his comrade was already galloping off past Vasíli the Beatified in the direction from which the screams came.</p><p>The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.</p></div> </div>
