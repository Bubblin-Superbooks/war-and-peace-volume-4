The Emperor!... He is here!&rdquo; thought Rostóv, who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged.</p><p>Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.</p><p>&ldquo;I may see him at any moment,&rdquo; thought Rostóv. &ldquo;If only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?&rdquo; thought he, looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied.</p></div> </div>
