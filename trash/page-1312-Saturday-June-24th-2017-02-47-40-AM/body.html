His head was aching, the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday&rsquo;s conversation with Captain Ramballe.</p><p>It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Ger√°sim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I not too late?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;No, probably he won&rsquo;t make his entry into Moscow before noon.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
