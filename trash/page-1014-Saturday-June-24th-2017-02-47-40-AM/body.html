<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Rostóvs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till the eve of the enemy&rsquo;s entry into the city.</p><p>After Pétya had joined Obolénski&rsquo;s regiment of Cossacks and left for Bélaya Tsérkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Pétya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. Pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service.</p></div> </div>
