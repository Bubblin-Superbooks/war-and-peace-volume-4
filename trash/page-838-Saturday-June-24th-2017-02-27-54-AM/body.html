But just as Daniel was about to go Natásha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse&rsquo;s big shawl wrapped round her. Pétya ran in at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; asked Natásha. &ldquo;I knew you would! Sónya said you wouldn&rsquo;t go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn&rsquo;t help going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we are going,&rdquo; replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natásha and Pétya. &ldquo;We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
