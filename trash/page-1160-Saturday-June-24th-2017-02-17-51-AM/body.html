<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My brother dined with me yesterday&mdash;we nearly died of laughter&mdash;he ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite madly, in love with you, my dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha blushed scarlet when she heard this.</p><p>&ldquo;How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!&rdquo; said Hélène. &ldquo;You must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fiancé would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre&mdash;that good Pierre&mdash;have talked and laughed about this. So it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; And again, under Hélène&rsquo;s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural.</p></div> </div>
