<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions, Campan&rsquo;s and Dessaix&rsquo;s, advanced from the French right, while Murat&rsquo;s troops advanced on Borodinó from their left.</p><p>From the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodinó, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix&rsquo;s division advancing against the flèches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the flèches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on the flèches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it.</p></div> </div>
