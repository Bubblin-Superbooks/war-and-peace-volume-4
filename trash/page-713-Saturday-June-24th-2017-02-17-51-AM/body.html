He was interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speránski and took his leave.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to so early?&rdquo; asked Speránski.</p><p>&ldquo;I promised to go to a reception.&rdquo;</p><p>They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what Speránski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince Andrew&rsquo;s ears long after he had left the house.</p></div> </div>
