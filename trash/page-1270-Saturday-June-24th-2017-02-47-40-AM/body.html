The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at Mytíshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man.</p><p>In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another fire.</p></div> </div>
