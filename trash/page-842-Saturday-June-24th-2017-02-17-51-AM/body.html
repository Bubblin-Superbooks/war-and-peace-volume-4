<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son&rsquo;s care, being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out with the others.</p><p>In an hour&rsquo;s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas, with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles, went past Natásha and Pétya who were trying to tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his chestnut Donéts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otrádnoe wood.</p></div> </div>
