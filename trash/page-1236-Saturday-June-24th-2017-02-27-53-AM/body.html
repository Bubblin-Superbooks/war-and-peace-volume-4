It&rsquo;s no use pretending: you listen when I speak to you!&rdquo; And Márya Dmítrievna touched her arm. &ldquo;Listen when I speak! You&rsquo;ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I&rsquo;d treat you differently, but I&rsquo;m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Márya Dmítrievna glanced round at Sónya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natásha.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I&rsquo;ll find him!&rdquo; she said in her rough voice. &ldquo;Do you hear what I am saying or not?&rdquo; she added.</p></div> </div>
