<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilínski arranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon&rsquo;s, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and a page of Napoleon&rsquo;s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French family. That same day, Rostóv, profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Borís and Zhilínski.</p><p>Rostóv, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French&mdash;who from being foes had suddenly become friends&mdash;that had taken place at headquarters and in Borís. In the army, Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt, and fear.</p></div> </div>
