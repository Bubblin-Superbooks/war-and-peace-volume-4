See her knife?...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a Tartar!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is it you didn&rsquo;t go head over heels?&rdquo; asked the boldest of all, addressing Natásha directly.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors.</p><p>The serfs all dispersed. &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; lifted Natásha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean&mdash;it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless&mdash;but neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.</p></div> </div>
