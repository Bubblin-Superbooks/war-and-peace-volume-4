What a good thing it would be!&rdquo;</p><p>Sónya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the Rostóvs&rsquo; affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. Pétya and Natásha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone.</p></div> </div>
