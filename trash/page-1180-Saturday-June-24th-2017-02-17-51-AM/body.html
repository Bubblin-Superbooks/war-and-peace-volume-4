What more could she write after all that had happened the evening before? &ldquo;Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is changed,&rdquo; she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her. &ldquo;Must I break off with him? Must I really? That&rsquo;s awful...&rdquo; and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sónya and began sorting patterns with her.</p><p>After dinner Natásha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;Can it be that it is all over?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
