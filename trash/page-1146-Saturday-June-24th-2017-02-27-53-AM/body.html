<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Shinshín had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French actresses&mdash;with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Danílov&rsquo;s or other Moscow revelers&rsquo;, drank whole nights through, outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years before&mdash;a fact known only to his most intimate friends.</p></div> </div>
