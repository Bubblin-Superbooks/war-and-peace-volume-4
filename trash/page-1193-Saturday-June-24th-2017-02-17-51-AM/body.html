<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Natásha did not answer her questions.</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Sónya, don&rsquo;t tell anyone, don&rsquo;t torture me,&rdquo; Natásha entreated. &ldquo;Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have confided in you....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why this secrecy? Why doesn&rsquo;t he come to the house?&rdquo; asked Sónya. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave you complete freedom&mdash;if it is really so; but I don&rsquo;t believe it! Natásha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha looked at Sónya with astonishment. Evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it.</p></div> </div>
