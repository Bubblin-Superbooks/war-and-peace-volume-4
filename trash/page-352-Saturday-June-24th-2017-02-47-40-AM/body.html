In his first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father&rsquo;s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew&rsquo;s second letter, written near VÃ­tebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army&rsquo;s direct line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.</p></div> </div>
