Toward midnight she went to Natásha&rsquo;s room fingering the key in her pocket. Sónya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. &ldquo;Márya Dmítrievna, for God&rsquo;s sake let me in to her!&rdquo; she pleaded, but Márya Dmítrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer.... &ldquo;Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I&rsquo;m only sorry for her father!&rdquo; thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. &ldquo;Hard as it may be, I&rsquo;ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count.&rdquo; She entered the room with resolute steps. Natásha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Márya Dmítrievna had left her.</p></div> </div>
