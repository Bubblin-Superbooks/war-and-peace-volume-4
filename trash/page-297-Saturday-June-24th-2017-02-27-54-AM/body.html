<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The duel between Pierre and DÃ³lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperor&rsquo;s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre&rsquo;s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage&mdash;when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him&mdash;especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court society&rsquo;s favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage.</p></div> </div>
