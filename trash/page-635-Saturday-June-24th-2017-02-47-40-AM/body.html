<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodinó were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevárdino Redoubt was an advanced post&mdash;whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank&mdash;and that the battle of Borodinó was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.</p><p>The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river Kolochá&mdash;which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle&mdash;so that the left flank was at Shevárdino, the right flank near the village of Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó at the confluence of the rivers Kolochá and Vóyna.</p></div> </div>
