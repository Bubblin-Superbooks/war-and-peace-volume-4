God grant it!&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.</p><p>The &ldquo;man of great merit,&rdquo; who was still a novice in court circles, wishing to flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on this question, observed:</p><p>&ldquo;It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to Kutúzov: &lsquo;Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; warmly rejoined Prince Vasíli, who would not now yield Kutúzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirable himself, but was adored by everybody. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
