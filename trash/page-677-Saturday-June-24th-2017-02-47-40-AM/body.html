But a militiaman got there before him. It was Dólokhov.</p><p>&ldquo;How did that fellow get here?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He&rsquo;s been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy&rsquo;s picket line at night.... He&rsquo;s a brave fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.</p></div> </div>
