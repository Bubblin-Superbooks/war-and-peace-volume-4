I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When I understood what he wanted&mdash;when I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: &lsquo;That is a monarch,&rsquo; and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or future.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
