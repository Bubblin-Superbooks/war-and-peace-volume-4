First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then Madame Schoss&rsquo; familiar whistling snore and Sónya&rsquo;s gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s asleep, Mamma,&rdquo; said Sónya softly.</p><p>After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied.</p><p>Soon after that Natásha heard her mother&rsquo;s even breathing. Natásha did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.</p></div> </div>
