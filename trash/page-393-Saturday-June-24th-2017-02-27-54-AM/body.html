<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>children of the whole universe. Don&rsquo;t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole? Don&rsquo;t I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deity&mdash;the Supreme Power if you prefer the term&mdash;is manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that is Herder&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, &ldquo;</p></div> </div>
