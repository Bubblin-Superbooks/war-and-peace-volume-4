God&rsquo;s will be done to us all!&rdquo; He sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. &ldquo;I loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that Kutúzov&rsquo;s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.</p></div> </div>
