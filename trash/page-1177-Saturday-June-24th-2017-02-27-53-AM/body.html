If the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otrádnoe.</p><p>&ldquo;That is perfectly true.

But if he won&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s his affair,&rdquo; said Márya Dmítrievna, looking for something in her reticule. &ldquo;Besides, the trousseau is ready, so there is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I&rsquo;ll send after you.
