<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in &ldquo;Boguch√°rovo Cloister,&rdquo; as his father called Prince Andrew&rsquo;s estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged behind himself&mdash;who never left the country&mdash;in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs.</p><p>Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations.</p></div> </div>
