A third officer galloped up to them.</p><p>&ldquo;The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail. This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to?... Where?...&rdquo; he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. &ldquo;Stop, you rascals!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how are you going to stop them?&rdquo; replied another officer. &ldquo;There is no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
