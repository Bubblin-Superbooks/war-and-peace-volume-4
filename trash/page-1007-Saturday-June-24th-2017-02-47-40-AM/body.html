Speránski and Magnítski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharëv has been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody. I like you and don&rsquo;t wish you any harm and&mdash;as you are only half my age&mdash;I advise you, as a father would, to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
