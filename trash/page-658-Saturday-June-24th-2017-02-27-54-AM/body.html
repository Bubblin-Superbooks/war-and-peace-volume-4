She kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.</p><p>&ldquo;SÃ³nya?&rdquo; she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair. &ldquo;No, how could she? She&rsquo;s virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how clever I am and how... charming she is,&rdquo; she went on, speaking of herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise man&mdash;the wisest and best of men&mdash;who was saying it of her. &ldquo;There is everything, everything in her,&rdquo; continued this man. &ldquo;She is unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly pretty, and agile&mdash;she swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One can really say it&rsquo;s a wonderful voice!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
