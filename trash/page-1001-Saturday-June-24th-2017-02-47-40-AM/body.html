The count was informed of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands. He asked one, &lsquo;From whom did you get it?&rsquo; &lsquo;From so-and-so.&rsquo; He went to the next one. &lsquo;From whom did you get it?&rsquo; and so on till he reached Vereshchágin, a half educated tradesman, you know, &lsquo;a pet of a trader,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the adjutant smiling. &ldquo;They asked him, &lsquo;Who gave it you?&rsquo; And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to some understanding. He replied: &lsquo;From no one; I made it up myself.</p></div> </div>
