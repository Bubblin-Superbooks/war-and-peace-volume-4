<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?&rdquo; And Anatole sighed and embraced Dólokhov.</p><p>&ldquo;I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it&mdash;a stupid business. Well, you&rsquo;ll carry her off&mdash;all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you&rsquo;re already married. Why, they&rsquo;ll have you in the criminal court....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I explain to you? What?&rdquo; And Anatole, with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dólokhov a hundred times.</p></div> </div>
