As it is we have played at war&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kindhearted that she can&rsquo;t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It&rsquo;s all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we humbugged them.</p></div> </div>
