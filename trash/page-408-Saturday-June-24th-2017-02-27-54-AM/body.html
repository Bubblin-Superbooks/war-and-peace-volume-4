There was a general who did not believe, and said, &lsquo;The monks cheat,&rsquo; and as soon as he&rsquo;d said it he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said, &lsquo;Believe in me and I will make you whole.&rsquo; So he begged: &lsquo;Take me to her, take me to her.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the real truth I&rsquo;m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says, &lsquo;Make me whole,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.</p></div> </div>
