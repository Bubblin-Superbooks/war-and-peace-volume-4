One God is above us both!&rdquo;&mdash;Vereshchágin&rsquo;s words suddenly recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchín smiled disdainfully at himself. &ldquo;I had other duties,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;The people had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good&rdquo;&mdash;and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself&mdash;not himself as Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín (he fancied that Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar. &ldquo;Had I been simply Theodore Vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
