<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Prince Andrew needed his father&rsquo;s consent to his marriage, and to obtain this he started for the country next day.</p><p>His father received his son&rsquo;s communication with external composure, but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already ending. &ldquo;If only they would let me end my days as I want to,&rdquo; thought the old man, &ldquo;then they might do as they please.&rdquo; With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.</p><p>In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress on this), while she was very young.</p></div> </div>
