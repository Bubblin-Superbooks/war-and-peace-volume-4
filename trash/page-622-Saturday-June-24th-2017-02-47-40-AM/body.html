And drive faster, blockhead!&rdquo; &ldquo;I must get away this very day,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.</p><p>At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the Lóbnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.</p><p>On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstáfey&mdash;his head coachman who knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow&mdash;that he would leave that night for the army at Mozháysk, and that his saddle horses should be sent there.</p></div> </div>
