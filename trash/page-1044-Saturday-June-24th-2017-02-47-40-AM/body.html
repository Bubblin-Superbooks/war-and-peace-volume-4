The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.</p><p>Sónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.</p><p>That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskáya, and Mávra Kuzmínichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the Rostóvs&rsquo; yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important man. He was being conveyed in a calèche with a raised hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.</p></div> </div>
