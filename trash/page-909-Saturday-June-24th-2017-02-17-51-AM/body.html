Mítka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balaláyka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was repeated a hundred times. The balaláyka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anísya Fëdorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.</p></div> </div>
