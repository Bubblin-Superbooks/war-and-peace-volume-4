It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man.

It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did her.&rdquo; And he vividly pictured to himself Nat√°sha, not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul.</p></div> </div>
