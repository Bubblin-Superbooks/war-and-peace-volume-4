She was only a couple of paces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman&rsquo;s dress, with tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sónya. She ran rapidly toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;Quite different and yet the same,&rdquo; thought Nicholas, looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight.

Sónya kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks.</p></div> </div>
