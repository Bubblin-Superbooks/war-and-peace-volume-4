<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby&rsquo;s head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself.</p></div> </div>
