Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spite of all his family&rsquo;s efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer&mdash;in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.</p></div> </div>
