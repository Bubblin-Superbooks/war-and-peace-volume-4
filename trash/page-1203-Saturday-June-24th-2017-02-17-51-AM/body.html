She let the girl go in, and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered.</p><p>Then suddenly it became clear to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful plan for that evening. Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let her in.</p><p>&ldquo;She will run away with him!&rdquo; thought Sónya. &ldquo;She is capable of anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,&rdquo; Sónya remembered. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?&rdquo; thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natásha had some terrible intention. &ldquo;The count is away.</p></div> </div>
