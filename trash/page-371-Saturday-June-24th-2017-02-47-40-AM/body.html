<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski&rsquo;s estate, lay forty miles east from Smolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.</p><p>The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpátych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew&rsquo;s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpátych to the Provincial Governor at Smolénsk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpátych with instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.</p></div> </div>
