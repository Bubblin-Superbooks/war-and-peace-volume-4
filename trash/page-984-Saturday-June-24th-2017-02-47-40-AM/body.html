Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone&rsquo;s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre&rsquo;s head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.</p></div> </div>
