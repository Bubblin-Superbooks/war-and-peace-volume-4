<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French circle of Hélène and Rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon&rsquo;s attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazán of the court and the girls&rsquo; educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In Hélène&rsquo;s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bilíbin&mdash;who now in Petersburg was quite at home in Hélène&rsquo;s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit&mdash;that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled.</p></div> </div>
