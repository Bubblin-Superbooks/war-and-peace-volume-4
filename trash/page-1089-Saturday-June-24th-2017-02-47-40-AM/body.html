We have recognized you! This is wonderful!&rdquo; she cried, holding out her hand to him. &ldquo;What are you doing? Why are you like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Count?&rdquo; asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone.</p><p>&ldquo;What? What? Why? Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Pierre, and looked round at Natásha whose radiant, happy expression&mdash;of which he was conscious without looking at her&mdash;filled him with enchantment.</p></div> </div>
