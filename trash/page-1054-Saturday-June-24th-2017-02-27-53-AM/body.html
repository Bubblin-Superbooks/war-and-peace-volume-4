Look at our youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned Métivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman Catholics and had the Pope&rsquo;s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so.</p></div> </div>
