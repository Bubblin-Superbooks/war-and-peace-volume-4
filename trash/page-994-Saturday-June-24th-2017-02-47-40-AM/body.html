Close to the gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;We have been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;The count wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter.&rdquo;</p><p>Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow commander in chief.</p><p>Count Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at Sokólniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders. Vasílchikov and Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered.</p></div> </div>
