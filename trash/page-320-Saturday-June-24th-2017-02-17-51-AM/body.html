<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards. The angel&rsquo;s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel&rsquo;s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel&rsquo;s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: &ldquo;Ah, why have you done this to me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
