<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone, I don&rsquo;t love anyone but him. How dare you say he is dishonorable? Don&rsquo;t you know that I love him?&rdquo; screamed Natásha. &ldquo;Go away, Sónya! I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with you, but go, for God&rsquo;s sake go! You see how I am suffering!&rdquo; Natásha cried angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sónya burst into sobs and ran from the room.</p><p>Natásha went to the table and without a moment&rsquo;s reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natásha.</p></div> </div>
