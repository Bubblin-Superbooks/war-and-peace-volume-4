This could not be done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon&rsquo;s instructions, moved them forward.</p><p>The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the wood, should turn the Russian left flank.
