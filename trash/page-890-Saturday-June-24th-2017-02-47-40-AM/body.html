<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: &ldquo;Enough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest, it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the question arose in every soul: &ldquo;For what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don&rsquo;t want to do so any more!&rdquo; By evening this thought had ripened in every soul.</p></div> </div>
