The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.</p><p>&ldquo;And who may you be?&rdquo; one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: &ldquo;If you want to eat we&rsquo;ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
