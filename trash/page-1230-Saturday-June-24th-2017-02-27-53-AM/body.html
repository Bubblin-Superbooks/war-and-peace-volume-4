Balagá took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and Dólokhov got in with him. Makárin, Khvóstikov, and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, are you ready?&rdquo; asked Balagá.</p><p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore down the Nikítski Boulevard.</p><p>&ldquo;Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...&rdquo; The shouting of Balagá and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard. On the Arbát Square the troyka caught against a carriage; something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the Arbát Street.</p></div> </div>
