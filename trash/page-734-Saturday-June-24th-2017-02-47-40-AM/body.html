Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; came those ecstatic cries.</p><p>After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset&rsquo;s presence dictated his order of the day to the army.</p><p>&ldquo;Short and energetic!&rdquo; he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It ran:</p><p>Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vítebsk, and Smolénsk. Let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of you: &ldquo;He was in the great battle before Moscow!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
