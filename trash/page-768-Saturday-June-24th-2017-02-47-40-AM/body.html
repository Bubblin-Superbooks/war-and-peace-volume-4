The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!&rdquo; he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Has it begun? Is it time?&rdquo; Pierre asked, waking up.</p></div> </div>
