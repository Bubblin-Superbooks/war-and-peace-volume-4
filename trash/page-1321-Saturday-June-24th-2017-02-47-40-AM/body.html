<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mary Nikol√°evna!&rdquo; said her husband to her in a low voice, evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. &ldquo;Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;Monster! Villain!&rdquo; shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep. &ldquo;You have no heart, you don&rsquo;t feel for your own child! Another man would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,&rdquo; she went on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. &ldquo;The fire broke out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; and we rushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...&rdquo; and again she began to sob. &ldquo;My child, my dear one! Burned, burned!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
