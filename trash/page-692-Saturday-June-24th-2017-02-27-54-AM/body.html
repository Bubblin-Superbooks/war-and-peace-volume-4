<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess remembers me,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying Per칩nskaya&rsquo;s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Nat치sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on Nat치sha&rsquo;s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I have long been waiting for you,&rdquo; that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she raised her hand to Prince Andrew&rsquo;s shoulder. They were the second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and Nat치sha danced exquisitely.</p></div> </div>
