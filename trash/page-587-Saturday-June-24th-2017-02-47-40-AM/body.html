Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!&rdquo; said Kutúzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face at this recollection.</p><p>Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offered his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man&rsquo;s eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov&rsquo;s tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him.</p></div> </div>
