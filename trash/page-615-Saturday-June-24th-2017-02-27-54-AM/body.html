<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.</p><p>27th November</p><p>I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God, help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Ur√∫sov came and we talked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor&rsquo;s new projects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor&rsquo;s words&mdash;that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist.</p></div> </div>
