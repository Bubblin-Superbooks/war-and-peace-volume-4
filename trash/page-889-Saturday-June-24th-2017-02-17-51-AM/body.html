The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who had been moving slowly, shouted, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; calling in the hounds, while the borzoi whips, with a cry of &ldquo;A-tu!&rdquo; galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare.

The hare they had started was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once.</p></div> </div>
