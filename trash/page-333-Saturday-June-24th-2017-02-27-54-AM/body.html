<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I begin ab ovo. &lsquo;The enemy of the human race,&rsquo; as you know, attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out that &lsquo;the enemy of the human race&rsquo; pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I most ardently desire,&rsquo; writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, &lsquo;that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end.</p></div> </div>
