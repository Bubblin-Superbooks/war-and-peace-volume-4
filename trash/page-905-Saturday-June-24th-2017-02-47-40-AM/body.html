<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men,&rdquo; says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch.</p></div> </div>
