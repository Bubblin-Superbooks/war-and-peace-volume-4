It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Long-coat&rdquo; as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another, and in her heart she sided with &ldquo;Granddad.&rdquo; In the midst of the conversation she noticed &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; give Bennigsen a quick, subtle glance, and then to her joys she saw that &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; said something to &ldquo;Long-coat&rdquo; which settled him.
