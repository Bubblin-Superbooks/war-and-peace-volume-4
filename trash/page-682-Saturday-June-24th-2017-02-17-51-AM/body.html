<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone else we know&mdash;Bolkónski, do you see, Mamma?&rdquo; said Natásha, pointing out Prince Andrew. &ldquo;You remember, he stayed a night with us at Otrádnoe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know him?&rdquo; said Perónskaya. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear him. Il fait à présent la pluie et le beau temps. * He&rsquo;s too proud for anything. Takes after his father. And he&rsquo;s hand in glove with Speránski, writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There&rsquo;s one talking to him and he has turned away,&rdquo; she said, pointing at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
