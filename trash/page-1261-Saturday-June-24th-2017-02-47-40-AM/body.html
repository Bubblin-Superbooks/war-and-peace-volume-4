<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain&rsquo;s memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually occurred in the captain&rsquo;s stories) and the Pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de c≈ìur) while himself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: &ldquo;I have saved your life, and I save your honor!&rdquo; Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.</p></div> </div>
