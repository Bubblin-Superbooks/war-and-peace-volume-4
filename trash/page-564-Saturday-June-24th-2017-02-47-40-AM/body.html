<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back.</p><p>Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness&rsquo; staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief&rsquo;s orderly speaks to officers, replied:</p><p>&ldquo;What? His Serene Highness? I expect he&rsquo;ll be here soon. What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly&rsquo;s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and approached Bolkónski with a slight bow. Bolkónski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.</p></div> </div>
