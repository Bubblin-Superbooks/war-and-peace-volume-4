The burning of Smolénsk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers. In the regiment they called him &ldquo;our prince,&rdquo; were proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Timókhin and the like&mdash;people quite new to him, belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past.</p></div> </div>
