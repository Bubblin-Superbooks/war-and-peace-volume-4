What a heart she has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy while Sónya was not,&rdquo; continued Natásha. &ldquo;Now I am so glad! Well, run back to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!&rdquo; cried Nicholas, peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. &ldquo;Natásha, it&rsquo;s magical, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You have done splendidly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
