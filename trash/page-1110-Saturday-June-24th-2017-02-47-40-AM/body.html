<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;From the height of the Krémlin&mdash;yes, there is the Krémlin, yes&mdash;I will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. &lsquo;Boyars,&rsquo; I will say to them, &lsquo;I do not desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects.&rsquo; However, I know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in Moscow? Yes, there she lies.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
