It was hot in the room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rost√≥v), who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself for having stayed.</p><p>He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the trees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there.</p></div> </div>
