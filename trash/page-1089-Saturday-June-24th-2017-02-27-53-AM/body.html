<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, now we&rsquo;ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You&rsquo;ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I&rsquo;ve known him since he was so high.&rdquo; She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground. Nat√°sha blushed happily. &ldquo;I like him and all his family. Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son&rsquo;s marrying. The old fellow&rsquo;s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without him, but it&rsquo;s not nice to enter a family against a father&rsquo;s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You&rsquo;re a clever girl and you&rsquo;ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will be well.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
