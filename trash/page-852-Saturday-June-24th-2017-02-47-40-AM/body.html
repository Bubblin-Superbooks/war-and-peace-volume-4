<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Prince Andrew&rsquo;s regiment was among the reserves which till after one o&rsquo;clock were stationed inactive behind Semënovsk, under heavy artillery fire. Toward two o&rsquo;clock the regiment, having already lost more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o&rsquo;clock.</p><p>Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly.</p></div> </div>
