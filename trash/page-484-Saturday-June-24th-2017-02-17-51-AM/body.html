He really was in their way, for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: &ldquo;And what is he sitting here for?&rdquo; He rose and went up to Borís.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m in your way,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;Come and talk over my business and I&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
