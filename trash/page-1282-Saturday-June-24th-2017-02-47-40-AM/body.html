<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nat치sha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,&rdquo; Nat치sha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Nat치sha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged a look with S칩nya.</p></div> </div>
