<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have been in Paris. I spent years there,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn&rsquo;t know Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la Duch√©nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,&rdquo; and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly: &ldquo;There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don&rsquo;t esteem you the less for it.&rdquo;</p><p>Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.</p></div> </div>
