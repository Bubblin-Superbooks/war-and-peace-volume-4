Several times parts of the Pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot&rsquo;s carriages. In April the Pávlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.</p><p>A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.</p><p>Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled&mdash;if any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them;</p></div> </div>
