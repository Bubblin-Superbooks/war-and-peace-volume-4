I say, Fëdor!&rdquo; said the foremost peasant.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into step.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency! Eh, Prince!&rdquo; said the trembling voice of Timókhin, who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.</p><p>Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped.</p><p>The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell.</p></div> </div>
