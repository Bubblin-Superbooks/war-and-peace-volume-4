<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You see he writes,&rdquo; said she, showing her son a letter of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a daughter&rsquo;s future married happiness, &ldquo;he writes that he won&rsquo;t come before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health is very delicate. Don&rsquo;t tell Nat√°sha. And don&rsquo;t attach importance to her being so bright: that&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s living through the last days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!&rdquo; (She always ended with these words.) &ldquo;He is an excellent man!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
