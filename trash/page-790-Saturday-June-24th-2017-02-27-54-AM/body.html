<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can&mdash;I will not say comfort us&mdash;but save us from despair. Religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life&mdash;not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others&mdash;are called away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget&mdash;that of my dear sister-in-law&mdash;left that impression on me.</p></div> </div>
