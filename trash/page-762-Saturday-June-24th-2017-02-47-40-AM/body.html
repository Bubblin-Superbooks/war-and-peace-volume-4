<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have neither taste nor smell,&rdquo; he remarked, sniffing at his glass. &ldquo;This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine&mdash;what is the good of medicine when it can&rsquo;t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but they don&rsquo;t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can&rsquo;t cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
