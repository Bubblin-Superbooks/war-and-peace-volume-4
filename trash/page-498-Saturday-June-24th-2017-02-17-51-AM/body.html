<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hardly had Rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining Denísov&rsquo;s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor&rsquo;s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperor&rsquo;s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rostóv knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostóv went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostóv&rsquo;s soul in all its old force.</p></div> </div>
