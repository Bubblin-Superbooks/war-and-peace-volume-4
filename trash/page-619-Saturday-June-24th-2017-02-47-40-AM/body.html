A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman&rsquo;s face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Who is it? What is it for?&rdquo; he kept asking.</p></div> </div>
