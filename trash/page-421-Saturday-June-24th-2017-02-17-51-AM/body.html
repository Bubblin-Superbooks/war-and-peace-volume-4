<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When returning from his leave, Rostóv felt, for the first time, how close was the bond that united him to Denísov and the whole regiment.</p><p>On approaching it, Rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Deméntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrúshka gleefully shouted to his master, &ldquo;The count has come!&rdquo; and Denísov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostóv experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents&rsquo; house.</p></div> </div>
