Wait, we must tie it up again.&rdquo;</p><p>Denísov was bandaged up again and put to bed.

The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.</p></div> </div>
