<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miláshka, dear!&rdquo; rose Nicholas&rsquo; triumphant cry. It looked as if Mílka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erzá reached him, but when close to the hare&rsquo;s scut paused as if measuring the distance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.</p><p>&ldquo;Erzá, darling!&rdquo; Ilágin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erzá did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble. Again Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly.</p></div> </div>
