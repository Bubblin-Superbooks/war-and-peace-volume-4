No, it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; thought Nicholas, still shouting with a hoarse voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Karáy, ulyulyu!...&rdquo; he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope. Karáy, with all the strength age had left him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf&rsquo;s lope and the borzoi&rsquo;s slower pace made it plain that Karáy had miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over.</p></div> </div>
