Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.</p><p>Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry.</p><p>Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts.</p><p>He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred.</p></div> </div>
