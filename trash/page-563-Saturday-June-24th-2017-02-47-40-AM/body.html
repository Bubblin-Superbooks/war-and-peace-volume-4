He stopped in the village at the priest&rsquo;s house in front of which stood the commander in chief&rsquo;s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutúzov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; to the new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutúzov&rsquo;s absence and of the fine weather.</p></div> </div>
