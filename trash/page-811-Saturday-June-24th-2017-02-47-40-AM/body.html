<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The chief action of the battle of Borodinó was fought within the seven thousand feet between Borodinó and Bagratión&rsquo;s flèches. Beyond that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians with Uvárov&rsquo;s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utítsa, Poniatowski&rsquo;s collision with Túchkov; but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodinó and the flèches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.</p><p>The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns.</p></div> </div>
