It is as if he thought my Bolkónski would not approve of or understand our gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?&rdquo; she thought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to think about it,&rdquo; she said to herself, and sat down again smilingly beside &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; begging him to play something more.</p></div> </div>
