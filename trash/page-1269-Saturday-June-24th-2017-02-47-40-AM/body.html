<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the retreating troops, with many different feelings.</p><p>The Rostóv party spent the night at Mytíshchi, fourteen miles from Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytíshchi. At ten o&rsquo;clock that evening the Rostóv family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village.</p></div> </div>
