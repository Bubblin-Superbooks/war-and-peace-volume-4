And she&rsquo;s expecting him&mdash;expecting him since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won&rsquo;t go on expecting him.&rdquo;</p><p>After hearing the details of Anatole&rsquo;s marriage from Pierre, and giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Márya Dmítrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or Bolkónski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre&mdash;only now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew&mdash;promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.</p></div> </div>
