There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns. The first person Rostóv met in the officers&rsquo; ward was a thin little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. Rostóv looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.</p><p>&ldquo;See where we&rsquo;ve met again!&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;Túshin, Túshin, don&rsquo;t you remember, who gave you a lift at Schön Grabern? And I&rsquo;ve had a bit cut off, you see...&rdquo; he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown.</p></div> </div>
