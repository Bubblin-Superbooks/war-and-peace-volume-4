<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.</p><p>&ldquo;Spring, love, happiness!&rdquo; this oak seemed to say. &ldquo;Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
