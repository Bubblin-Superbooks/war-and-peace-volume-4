That was the only part of the fourth act that Nat치sha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kur치gin whom she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was putting Nat치sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow.
