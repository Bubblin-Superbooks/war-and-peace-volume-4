<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The general comes to us, Suvórov-like, in a kibítka, and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph.</p><p>&ldquo;On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are taken to the field marshal&rsquo;s room, for he likes to do everything himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others.</p></div> </div>
