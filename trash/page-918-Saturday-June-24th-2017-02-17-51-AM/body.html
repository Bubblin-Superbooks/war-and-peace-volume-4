<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After nine o&rsquo;clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent to look for them, arrived to fetch Natásha and Pétya. The count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of the men.</p><p>Pétya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps. Natásha and Nicholas got into the other. &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; wrapped Natásha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.</p></div> </div>
