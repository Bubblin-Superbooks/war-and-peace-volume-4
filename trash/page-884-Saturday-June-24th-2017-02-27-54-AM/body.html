<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilágin about the year&rsquo;s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.</p><p>&ldquo;A fine little bitch, that!&rdquo; said he in a careless tone. &ldquo;Is she swift?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That one? Yes, she&rsquo;s a good dog, gets what she&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; answered Ilágin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erzá, for which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. &ldquo;So in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?&rdquo; he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering it polite to return the young count&rsquo;s compliment, Ilágin looked at his borzois and picked out Mílka who attracted his attention by her breadth. &ldquo;That black-spotted one of yours is fine&mdash;well shaped!&rdquo; said he.</p></div> </div>
