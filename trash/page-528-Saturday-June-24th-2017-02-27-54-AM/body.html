This Marshal was Count Ilyá Rostóv, and in the middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him.</p><p>It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe.</p><p>Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the Rostóvs&rsquo; house at Otrádnoe.
