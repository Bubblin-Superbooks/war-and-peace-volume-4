Natásha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by Pétya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom appointed to look after her. Pétya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled at his horse. Natásha sat easily and confidently on her black Arábchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; looked round disapprovingly at Pétya and Natásha. He did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.</p></div> </div>
