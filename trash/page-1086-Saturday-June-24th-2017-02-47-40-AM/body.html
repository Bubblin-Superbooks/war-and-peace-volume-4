<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Kúdrino, from the Nikítski, Présnya, and Podnovínsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostóvs&rsquo;, and as they passed along the Sadóvaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast.</p><p>As they were going round the Súkharev water tower Natásha, who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me! Mamma, Sónya, look, it&rsquo;s he!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look! Yes, on my word, it&rsquo;s Bezúkhov!&rdquo; said Natásha, putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman&rsquo;s long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the Súkharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.</p></div> </div>
