On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and greetings deafened Natásha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals, &ldquo;Charmé de vous voir,&rdquo; * greeted the Rostóvs and Perónskaya in the same manner.</p><p>The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess&rsquo; eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natásha. She looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed Natásha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.</p></div> </div>
