<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor&mdash;Métivier&mdash;who had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but as an equal.</p><p>Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him. Métivier came to see the prince about twice a week.</p><p>On December 6&mdash;St. Nicholas&rsquo; Day and the prince&rsquo;s name day&mdash;all Moscow came to the prince&rsquo;s front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to Princess Mary.</p></div> </div>
