Both Márya Dmítrievna and Sónya were amazed when they saw how Natásha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her cheeks sunken.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!&rdquo; she muttered, wrenching herself from Márya Dmítrievna&rsquo;s hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position.</p><p>&ldquo;Natalie!&rdquo; said Márya Dmítrievna. &ldquo;I wish for your good. Lie still, stay like that then, I won&rsquo;t touch you. But listen. I won&rsquo;t tell you how guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?
