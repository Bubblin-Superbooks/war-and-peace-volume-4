<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place.</p><p>Natásha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls. While Natásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and, meeting the count&rsquo;s eyes, nodded to him and smiled. She was the Countess Bezúkhova, Pierre&rsquo;s wife, and the count, who knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.</p></div> </div>
