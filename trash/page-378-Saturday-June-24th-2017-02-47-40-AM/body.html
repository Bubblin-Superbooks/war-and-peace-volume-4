He asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.</p><p>All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpátych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o&rsquo;clock it was already hot. &ldquo;A good day for harvesting,&rdquo; thought Alpátych.</p><p>From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight o&rsquo;clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual. Alpátych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
