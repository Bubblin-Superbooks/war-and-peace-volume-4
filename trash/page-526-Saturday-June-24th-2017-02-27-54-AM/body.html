<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew. &ldquo;Let others&mdash;the young&mdash;yield afresh to that fraud, but we know life, our life is finished!&rdquo;</p><p>A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything anew&mdash;but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or desiring anything.</p></div> </div>
