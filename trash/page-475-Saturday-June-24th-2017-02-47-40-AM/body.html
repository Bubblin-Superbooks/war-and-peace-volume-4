The Prince,&rdquo; said Dunyásha in a breaking voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately, I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; replied the princess hurriedly, not giving Dunyásha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Princess, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will! You must be prepared for everything,&rdquo; said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone; it&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; she cried angrily to him.</p><p>The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her father&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me? I don&rsquo;t want any of them! And what are they doing here?&rdquo; she thought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women.</p></div> </div>
