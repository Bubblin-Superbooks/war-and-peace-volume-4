Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father&rsquo;s absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.</p><p>Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to Princess Mary&rsquo;s apartments, but did not find him there. He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.</p><p>&ldquo;If you please, your excellency, PÃ©trusha has brought some papers,&rdquo; said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child&rsquo;s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.</p></div> </div>
