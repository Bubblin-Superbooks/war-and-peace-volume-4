Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow,&rdquo; said Métivier; and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away.</p><p>Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry: &ldquo;Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment&rsquo;s peace in my own house!&rdquo;</p><p>After Métivier&rsquo;s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he could not have a moment&rsquo;s peace and could not die quietly.</p></div> </div>
