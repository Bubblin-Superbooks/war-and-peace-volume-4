He spoke in French. &ldquo;I only know two very real evils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And love of one&rsquo;s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?&rdquo; began Pierre. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying&rdquo; (Pierre&rsquo;s modesty made him correct himself) &ldquo;to live for others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life.</p></div> </div>
