In the stalls everyone began moving about, going out and coming in.</p><p>Borís came to the Rostóvs&rsquo; box, received their congratulations very simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to Natásha and Sónya his fiancée&rsquo;s invitation to her wedding, and went away. Natásha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Borís with whom she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in, everything seemed simple and natural.</p></div> </div>
