He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and dozed off. Alpátych made a slight movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I&rsquo;ll send after you.&rdquo;</p><p>Alpátych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table to write to the governor.</p><p>It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tíkhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.</p></div> </div>
