<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Another man&mdash;Timókhin&mdash;was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others&mdash;the doctor and a valet&mdash;lay on the floor.</p><p>The valet sat up and whispered something. Timókhin, kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet&rsquo;s sleepy, frightened exclamation, &ldquo;What do you want? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always seen him.</p></div> </div>
