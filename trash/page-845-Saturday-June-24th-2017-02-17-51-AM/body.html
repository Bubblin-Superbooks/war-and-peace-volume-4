I was sure of it,&rdquo; began &ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo; (He was a distant relative of the Rostóvs&rsquo;, a man of small means, and their neighbor.) &ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist it and it&rsquo;s a good thing you&rsquo;re going. That&rsquo;s it! Come on!&rdquo; (This was &ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s&rdquo; favorite expression.) &ldquo;Take the covert at once, for my Gírchik says the Ilágins are at Kornikí with their hounds. That&rsquo;s it. Come on!... They&rsquo;ll take the cubs from under your very nose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going. Shall we join up our packs?&rdquo; asked Nicholas.</p></div> </div>
