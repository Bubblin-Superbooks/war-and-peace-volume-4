Had Speránski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolkónski would soon have discovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speránski&rsquo;s strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him.</p></div> </div>
