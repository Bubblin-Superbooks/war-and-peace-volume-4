<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> May I have succeeded!&rsquo; The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.</p><p>&ldquo;The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is absolutely true.</p><p>&ldquo;In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozoróvski and Kámenski the latter was preferred.</p></div> </div>
