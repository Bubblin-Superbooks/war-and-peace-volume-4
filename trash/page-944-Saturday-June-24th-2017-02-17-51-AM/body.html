A storm?&rdquo; she ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before,&rdquo; thought Natásha, &ldquo;and in just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!&rdquo; and Natásha sang the air of the chorus so that Sónya should catch it. &ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p></div> </div>
