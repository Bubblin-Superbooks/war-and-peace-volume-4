<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during that time:</p><p>24th November</p><p>Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph Alex√©evich&rsquo;s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined alone&mdash;the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it.</p></div> </div>
