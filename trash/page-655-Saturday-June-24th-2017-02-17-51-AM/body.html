But this is what I&rsquo;ll do, Natásha, I&rsquo;ll have a talk with Borís. He need not come so often....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, if he likes to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I know it will end in nothing....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you know? No, Mamma, don&rsquo;t speak to him! What nonsense!&rdquo; said Natásha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it.&rdquo; Natásha smiled and looked at her mother. &ldquo;Not to marry, but just so,&rdquo; she added.</p></div> </div>
