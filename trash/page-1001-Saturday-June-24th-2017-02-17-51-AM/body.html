O, God, how afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...&rdquo; Natásha began, and without replying to Sónya&rsquo;s words of comfort she got into bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless, gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.</p></div> </div>
