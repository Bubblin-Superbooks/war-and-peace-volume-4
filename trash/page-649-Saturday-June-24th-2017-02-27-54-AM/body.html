<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below. Natásha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but seeing, that Natásha&rsquo;s head was covered, she smiled in her kind, weak way.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, now then!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?&rdquo; said Natásha. &ldquo;Now, just one on your throat and another... that&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; And seizing her mother round the neck, she kissed her on the throat.</p></div> </div>
