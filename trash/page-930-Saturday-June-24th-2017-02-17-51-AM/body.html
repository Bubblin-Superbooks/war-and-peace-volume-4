I wonder how Mamma could speak so to me. Because Sónya is poor I must not love her,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can always sacrifice my feelings for my family&rsquo;s welfare,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t coerce my feelings. If I love Sónya, that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
