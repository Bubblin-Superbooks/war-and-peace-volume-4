One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in Petersburg. Nat√°sha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to say: &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m not telling it right; no, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say.</p></div> </div>
