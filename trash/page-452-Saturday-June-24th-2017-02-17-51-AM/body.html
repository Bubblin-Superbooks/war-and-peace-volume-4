Rostóv, who felt his friend&rsquo;s absence very much, having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denísov in hospital.</p><p>The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated by Russian and French troops.
