<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Gerásim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things, accepted Pierre&rsquo;s taking up his residence in the house without surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening&mdash;without even asking himself what they were wanted for&mdash;he procured a coachman&rsquo;s coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day. Makár Alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman&rsquo;s coat which Gerásim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Súkharev market that he met the Rostóvs.</p></div> </div>
