She knew that Sónya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession. So Natásha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I spoiled for Andrew&rsquo;s love or not?&rdquo; she asked herself, and with soothing irony replied: &ldquo;What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn&rsquo;t lead him on at all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;So it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still.</p></div> </div>
