She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Borís Drubetskóy, who was visiting them for the third time already.</p><p>Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room.</p><p>&ldquo;May I stay a little longer?&rdquo; he said, letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her.</p></div> </div>
