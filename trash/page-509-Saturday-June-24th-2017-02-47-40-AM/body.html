<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Drónushka? Isn&rsquo;t it possible to help them? I&rsquo;ll do all I can....&rdquo;</p><p>To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as &ldquo;landlord&rsquo;s corn&rdquo; which was sometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the peasants&rsquo; needs and what there was in Boguchárovo that belonged to the landlord.</p></div> </div>
