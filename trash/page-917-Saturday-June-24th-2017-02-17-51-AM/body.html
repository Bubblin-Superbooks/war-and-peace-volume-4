<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; played another song and a valse; then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; sang as peasants sing, with full and naïve conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Natásha was in ecstasies over &ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s&rdquo; singing. She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.</p></div> </div>
