Shouldn&rsquo;t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, go in there and drive them out!&rdquo; shouted the senior officer.</p><p>The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your honor!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Be so good as to protect us! We won&rsquo;t grudge trifles, you are welcome to anything&mdash;we shall be delighted! Pray!... I&rsquo;ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure.</p></div> </div>
