He came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner&mdash;I gave him a pretty dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,&rdquo; the old prince went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. &ldquo;A fine fellow&mdash;your friend&mdash;I like him! He stirs me up. Another says clever things and one doesn&rsquo;t care to listen, but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I&rsquo;ll come and sit with you at supper. We&rsquo;ll have another dispute. Make friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,&rdquo; he shouted after Pierre, through the door.</p></div> </div>
