What&rsquo;s one to do?&rdquo; he asked, evidently expecting an answer. &ldquo;Well, what do you want us to do?&rdquo; he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not reply: &ldquo;I will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;abstiens-toi&rdquo; *(2)&mdash;he articulated the French proverb deliberately.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
