Márya Dmítrievna appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natásha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.</p><p>After breakfast, which was her best time, Márya Dmítrievna sat down in her armchair and called Natásha and the count to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince Bolkónski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had to say!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
