Isn&rsquo;t it all the same?&rdquo; The doctor noticed Rostóv coming upstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, sir?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;What do you want? The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Rostóv.</p><p>&ldquo;Typhus, sir. It&rsquo;s death to go in. Only we two, Makéev and I&rdquo; (he pointed to the assistant), &ldquo;keep on here. Some five of us doctors have died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,&rdquo; said the doctor with evident satisfaction. &ldquo;Prussian doctors have been invited here, but our allies don&rsquo;t like it at all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
