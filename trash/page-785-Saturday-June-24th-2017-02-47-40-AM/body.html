You&rsquo;ll see everything from there and it&rsquo;s less dangerous, and I&rsquo;ll come for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day.</p><p>The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Ra√©vski&rsquo;s Redoubt, and to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as the key to the whole position.</p></div> </div>
