If we had had only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,&rdquo; said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. &ldquo;I am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.

If you don&rsquo;t want to make me blush, please don&rsquo;t thank me!&rdquo;</p><p>But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and tenderness.
