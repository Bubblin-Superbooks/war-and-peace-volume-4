<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another.</p><p>Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Kar√°gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey.</p><p>Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.</p></div> </div>
