The tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natásha, arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anísya Fëdorovna&rsquo;s whole being. Anísya Fëdorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room.</p></div> </div>
