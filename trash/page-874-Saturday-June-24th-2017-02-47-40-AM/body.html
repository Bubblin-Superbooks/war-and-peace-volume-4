Oh, ooh!&rdquo; he sobbed, like a woman.</p><p>The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.</p><p>&ldquo;My God! What is this? Why is he here?&rdquo; said Prince Andrew to himself.</p><p>In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated, he recognized Anatole Kur√°gin. Men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. &ldquo;Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him. &ldquo;What is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?&rdquo; he asked himself without finding an answer.</p></div> </div>
