We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those were horses!&rdquo; Balagá continued the tale. &ldquo;That time I&rsquo;d harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,&rdquo; he went on, turning to Dólokhov. &ldquo;Will you believe it, Theodore Iványch, those animals flew forty miles? I couldn&rsquo;t hold them in, my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins&mdash;&lsquo;Catch hold yourself, your excellency!&rsquo; says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there.</p></div> </div>
