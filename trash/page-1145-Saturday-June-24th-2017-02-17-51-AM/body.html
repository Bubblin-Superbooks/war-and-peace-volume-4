He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Karágina.</p><p>Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre&rsquo;s house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him money under the guise of loans.</p></div> </div>
