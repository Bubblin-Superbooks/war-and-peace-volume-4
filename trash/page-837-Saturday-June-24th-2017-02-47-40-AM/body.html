<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat Kut√∫zov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, do that,&rdquo; he replied to various proposals. &ldquo;Yes, yes: go, dear boy, and have a look,&rdquo; he would say to one or another of those about him; or, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d better wait!&rdquo; He listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in something else&mdash;in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting.</p></div> </div>
