<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After her father&rsquo;s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alp√°tych was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.</p><p>The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject&mdash;the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had shown itself during her father&rsquo;s illness.</p></div> </div>
