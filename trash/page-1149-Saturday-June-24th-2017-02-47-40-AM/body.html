The factory hands and others followed behind, talking and shouting.</p><p>At the corner of the Moros√©yka, opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker&rsquo;s signboard, stood a score of thin, worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered coats.</p><p>&ldquo;He should pay folks off properly,&rdquo; a thin workingman, with frowning brows and a straggly beard, was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s sucked our blood and now he thinks he&rsquo;s quit of us. He&rsquo;s been misleading us all the week and now that he&rsquo;s brought us to this pass he&rsquo;s made off.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
