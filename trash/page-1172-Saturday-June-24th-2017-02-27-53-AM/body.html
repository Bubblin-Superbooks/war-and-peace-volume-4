She loved Prince Andrew&mdash;she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. &ldquo;Else how could all this have happened?&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;If, after that, I could return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to that, it means that I loved him from the first.
