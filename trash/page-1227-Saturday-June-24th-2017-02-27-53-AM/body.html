Go to Matrëna Matrévna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what elopements are like,&rdquo; continued Dólokhov with a wink. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;ll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay at all there&rsquo;ll be tears and &lsquo;Papa&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; and she&rsquo;s frozen in a minute and must go back&mdash;but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
