The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.</p><p>Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.</p></div> </div>
