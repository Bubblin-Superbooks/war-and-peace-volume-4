But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you, a second father....&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father&rsquo;s death, and what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.</p><p>&ldquo;What... what they have brought us to!&rdquo; Kutúzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince Andrew&rsquo;s story the condition Russia was in. &ldquo;But give me time, give me time!&rdquo; he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation, and added: &ldquo;I sent for you to keep you with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
