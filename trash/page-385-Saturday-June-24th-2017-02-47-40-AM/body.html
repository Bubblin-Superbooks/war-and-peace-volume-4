<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets. Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferap칩ntov&rsquo;s and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses.</p><p>Alp치tych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage. From the host&rsquo;s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferap칩ntov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as Alp치tych entered.</p></div> </div>
