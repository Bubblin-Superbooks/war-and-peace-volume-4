Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.</p><p>The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpátych liked to have them. His satellites&mdash;the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various domestic serfs&mdash;were seeing him off.</p></div> </div>
