<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My father is chief in command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you are serving?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused a little while.</p><p>&ldquo;And why do you serve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster&rsquo;s clerk at YÃºkhnovna hanged,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew with a smile. &ldquo;So I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
