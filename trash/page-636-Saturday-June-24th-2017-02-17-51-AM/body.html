<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazán estate or of selling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count&rsquo;s study early one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what Véra&rsquo;s dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head. &ldquo;I like your being businesslike about it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
