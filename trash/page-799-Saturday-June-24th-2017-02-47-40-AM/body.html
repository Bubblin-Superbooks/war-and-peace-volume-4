Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.</p><p>A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.</p><p>&ldquo;All with grapeshot!&rdquo; shouted the officer.</p><p>The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.</p></div> </div>
