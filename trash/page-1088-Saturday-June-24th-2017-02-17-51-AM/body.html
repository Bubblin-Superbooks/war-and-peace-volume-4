All right. They&rsquo;ll be safe with me, as safe as in Chancery! I&rsquo;ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit,&rdquo; said Márya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite, Natásha, on the cheek with her large hand.</p><p>Next morning Márya Dmítrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so afraid of Márya Dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her. Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room except Natásha, and then called her pet to her armchair.</p></div> </div>
