<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Kolochá Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops&mdash;ours and the enemy&rsquo;s. The ground to the right&mdash;along the course of the Kolochá and Moskvá rivers&mdash;was broken and hilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of Semënovsk, which had been burned down, could be seen.</p><p>All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.</p></div> </div>
