Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now doubled, moved on.</p><p>The way to Iligin&rsquo;s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants fell into line. The masters rode together. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; Rostóv, and Ilágin kept stealthily glancing at one another&rsquo;s dogs, trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois.</p><p>Rostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Ilágin&rsquo;s leash, slender but with muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of the swiftness of Ilágin&rsquo;s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Mílka.</p></div> </div>
