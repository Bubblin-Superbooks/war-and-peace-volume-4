The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while&mdash;instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne&mdash;a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.</p></div> </div>
