Have a drink!&rdquo; said Anatole, and filled a large glass of Madeira for him.</p><p>The driver&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing it for manners&rsquo; sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.</p><p>&ldquo;And when are we to start, your excellency?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; Anatole looked at his watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start at once. Mind, Balagá! You&rsquo;ll get there in time? Eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn&rsquo;t we be there in time?&rdquo; replied Balagá. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we get you to Tver in seven hours?
