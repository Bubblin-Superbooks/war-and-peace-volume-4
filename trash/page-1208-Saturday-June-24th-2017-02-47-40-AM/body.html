But despite all these measures the men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.</p><p>No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers&mdash;like water percolating through sand&mdash;spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Kr√©mlin into which they had first marched.</p></div> </div>
