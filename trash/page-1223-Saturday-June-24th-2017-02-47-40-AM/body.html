<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of Makár Alexéevich, always so timid before but now quite transformed.</p><p>His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but noticing embarrassment on Pierre&rsquo;s face immediately grew bold and, staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re frightened,&rdquo; he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;I say I won&rsquo;t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
