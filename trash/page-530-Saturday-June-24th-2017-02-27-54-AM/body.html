<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1809 Count Ily치 Rost칩v was living at Otr치dnoe just as he had done in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying the night.</p><p>During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old count&rsquo;s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day), Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Nat치sha, gay and laughing among the younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, &ldquo;What is she thinking about? Why is she so glad?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
