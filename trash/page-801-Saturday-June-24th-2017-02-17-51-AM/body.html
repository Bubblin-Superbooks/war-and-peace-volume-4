The next day the old prince said to her quietly:</p><p>&ldquo;Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won&rsquo;t be long&mdash;I shall soon set him free.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich, eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas&rsquo; stepmother and I&rsquo;ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn&rsquo;t be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted in my house&mdash;let him marry and live by himself.</p></div> </div>
