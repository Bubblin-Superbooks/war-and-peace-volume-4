<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination, and &ldquo;the bird restored to its native fields&rdquo; galloped to our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Plátov&rsquo;s detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rostóv, quartered at Yankóvo. Rostóv was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyín; he let Lavrúshka have another horse and took him along with him.</p></div> </div>
