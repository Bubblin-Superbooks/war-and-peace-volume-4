His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.</p><p>From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying, &ldquo;Straight, straight, along the path, Miss. Only, don&rsquo;t look back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; answered Sónya&rsquo;s voice, and along the path toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sónya&rsquo;s feet in her thin shoes.</p></div> </div>
