<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate with you,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count&rdquo; (Berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable), &ldquo;and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo; (He smiled still more pleasantly.)</p></div> </div>
