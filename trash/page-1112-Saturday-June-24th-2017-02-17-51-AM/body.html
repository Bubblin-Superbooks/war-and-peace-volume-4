<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Natásha looked in the direction in which her father&rsquo;s eyes were turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck&mdash;which Natásha knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to Julie&rsquo;s mouth, was Borís&rsquo; handsome smoothly brushed head. He looked at the Rostóvs from under his brows and said something, smiling, to his betrothed.</p><p>&ldquo;They are talking about us, about me and him!&rdquo; thought Natásha. &ldquo;And he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn&rsquo;t trouble themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
