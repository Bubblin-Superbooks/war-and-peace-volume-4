<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old count&rsquo;s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse, the fourth was Nicholas&rsquo; own with a short shaggy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old lady&rsquo;s dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.</p><p>It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.</p><p>Natásha, Sónya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas&rsquo; sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Pétya, into the old count&rsquo;s, and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.</p></div> </div>
