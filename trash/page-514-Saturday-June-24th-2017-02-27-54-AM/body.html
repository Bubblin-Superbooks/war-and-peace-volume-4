If we&rsquo;re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it&rsquo;s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; shouted Nicholas, banging the table&mdash;very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.</p></div> </div>
