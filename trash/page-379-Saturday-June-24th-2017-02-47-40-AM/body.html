<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one another.</p><p>In front of the Governor&rsquo;s house Alp√°tych found a large number of people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor&rsquo;s. At the porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke, you know! It&rsquo;s all very well if you&rsquo;re single. &lsquo;One man though undone is but one,&rsquo; as the proverb says, but with thirteen in your family and all the property... They&rsquo;ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged&mdash;the brigands!...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
