Now mind, don&rsquo;t tell her everything!&rdquo; said she to Pierre. &ldquo;One hasn&rsquo;t the heart to scold her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.</p><p>Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different expression of face.</p></div> </div>
