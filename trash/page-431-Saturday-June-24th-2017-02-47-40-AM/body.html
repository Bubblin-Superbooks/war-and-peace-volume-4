<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm&mdash;news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor&rsquo;s return&mdash;was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.</p><p>Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. Prince Vasíli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He visited his &ldquo;good friend Anna Pávlovna&rdquo; as well as his daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;diplomatic salon,&rdquo; and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at Hélène&rsquo;s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s and vice versa.</p></div> </div>
