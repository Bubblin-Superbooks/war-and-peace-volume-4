I&rsquo;ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskóy who drives me to it!&rdquo; And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect, Rostóv felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,&rdquo; he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. &ldquo;I will fall at his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me. &lsquo;I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness,&rsquo;&rdquo; Rostóv fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperor&rsquo;s house.</p></div> </div>
