Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre&rsquo;s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.</p><p>&ldquo;So you understand the whole position of our troops?&rdquo; Prince Andrew interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, how do you mean?&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Not being a military man I can&rsquo;t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
