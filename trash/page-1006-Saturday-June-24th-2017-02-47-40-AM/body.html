<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in chief.</p><p>When he entered the private room Count Rostopchín, puckering his face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, how do you do, great warrior?&rdquo; said Rostopchín as soon as the short man had left the room. &ldquo;We have heard of your prowess. But that&rsquo;s not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?&rdquo; he went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. &ldquo;I am well informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin Russia.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
