They were howling there.&rdquo; (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otrádnoe copse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)</p><p>&ldquo;We ought to go, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; said Nicholas. &ldquo;Come to me with Uvárka.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
