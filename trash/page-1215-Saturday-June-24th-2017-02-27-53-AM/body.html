<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balagá was a famous troyka driver who had known Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole&rsquo;s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again the next night. More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and &ldquo;ladykins&rdquo; as he called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by &ldquo;my gentlemen&rdquo; as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in their service.</p></div> </div>
