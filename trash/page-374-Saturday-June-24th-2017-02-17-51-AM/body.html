<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No, I shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying.&rdquo; Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.</p><p>&ldquo;When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you&rsquo;ll get on with her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right for yourself,&rdquo; he added after a short pause, &ldquo;but everyone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.&mdash;And after all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.&mdash;So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
