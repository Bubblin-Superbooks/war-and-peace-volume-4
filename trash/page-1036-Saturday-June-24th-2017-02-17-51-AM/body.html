<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day in Moscow in Princess Mary&rsquo;s presence (she thought her father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary&rsquo;s room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...&rdquo; She did not finish. &ldquo;Leave my room,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.</p></div> </div>
