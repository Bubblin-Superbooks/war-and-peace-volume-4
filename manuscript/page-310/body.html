Now it would roll on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.</p><p>Pierre&rsquo;s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier&rsquo;s trousers which by Karat√°ev&rsquo;s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family.

The look of his eyes was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before.</p></div> </div>
