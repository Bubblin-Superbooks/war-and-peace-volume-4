<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.</p><p>Nat치sha&rsquo;s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life&mdash;love&mdash;was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.</p><p>Prince Andrew&rsquo;s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat치sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat치sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother&rsquo;s bedroom had strained Nat치sha&rsquo;s physical strength.</p></div> </div>
