Robbery in the law courts, in the army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,&rdquo; said Pierre (as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began). &ldquo;I told them just one thing in Petersburg.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Told whom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know whom,&rdquo; said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under his brows. &ldquo;Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
