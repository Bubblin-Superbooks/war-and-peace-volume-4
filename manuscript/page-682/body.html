<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with children who were with the French transport, all&mdash;carried on by vis inerti√¶&mdash;pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and did not, surrender.</p><p>That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners&mdash;with whom the Russians did not know what to do&mdash;perished of cold and hunger despite their captors&rsquo; desire to save them; they felt that it could not be otherwise.</p></div> </div>
