I am afraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy&mdash;as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an untruth.</p></div> </div>
