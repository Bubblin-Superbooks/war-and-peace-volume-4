She sat down and played with them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to the small sitting room.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is not asleep; I&rsquo;ll have an explanation with him,&rdquo; she said to herself.
