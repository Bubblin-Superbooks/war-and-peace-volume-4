<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I understand,&rdquo; said the governor&rsquo;s wife.</p><p>&ldquo;But Princess Bolkónskaya&mdash;that&rsquo;s another matter. I will tell you the truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and then, after I met her under such circumstances&mdash;so strangely, the idea often occurred to me: &lsquo;This is fate.&rsquo; Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long as my sister Natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen that I should meet her just when Natásha&rsquo;s engagement had been broken off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone and never will, only to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
