<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man&rsquo;s free will and partly of the law of inevitability.</p><p>Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone&rsquo;s action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us.</p><p>Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability.</p></div> </div>
