<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy, his opponents&rsquo; reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic considerations the Russian armies&mdash;just those which might have destroyed his prestige&mdash;do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.</p><p>On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed.</p></div> </div>
