However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action, our own or another&rsquo;s, the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action.</p><p>But even if&mdash;imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause&mdash;we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.</p></div> </div>
