<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Emperor&rsquo;s displeasure with Kutúzov was specially increased at Vílna by the fact that Kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign.</p><p>When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled about him: &ldquo;You have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!&rdquo; they all understood that the war was not ended.</p><p>Kutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and so forth.</p></div> </div>
