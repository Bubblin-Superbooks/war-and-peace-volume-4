<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>His physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: &ldquo;Lord, lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!&rdquo; and every morning on getting up, he said: &ldquo;I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.&rdquo; And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment&rsquo;s delay for some work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation&mdash;of which he was fond&mdash;and songs.</p></div> </div>
