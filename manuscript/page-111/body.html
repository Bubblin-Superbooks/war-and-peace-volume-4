In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be&mdash;perhaps a very important person&mdash;and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him.</p><p>But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the new guard&mdash;both officers and men&mdash;he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command.</p></div> </div>
