<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tíkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones. Tíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm&rsquo;s length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons. In Denísov&rsquo;s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done&mdash;to push a cart out of the mud with one&rsquo;s shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a day&mdash;everybody pointed laughingly at Tíkhon.</p></div> </div>
