The other, from the countess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them; his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more hope.

Neither he nor she said a word about what &ldquo;Natásha nursing him&rdquo; might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations.</p></div> </div>
