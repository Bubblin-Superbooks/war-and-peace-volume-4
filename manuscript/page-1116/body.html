<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer to the essence of man&rsquo;s free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions.</p><p>In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science.</p><p>The subject for history is not man&rsquo;s will itself but our presentation of it.</p><p>And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of man&rsquo;s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place.</p></div> </div>
