<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Very often a wounded animal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter&rsquo;s gun, runs forward and back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tar√∫tino frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter&rsquo;s gun, reached him, turned back, and finally&mdash;like any wild beast&mdash;ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was familiar.</p><p>During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements&mdash;as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel&mdash;acted like a child who, holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.</p></div> </div>
