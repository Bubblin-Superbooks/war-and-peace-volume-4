In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the Dnieper&mdash;which was the only reasonable thing for him to do&mdash;themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Krásnoe. And here as in a game of blindman&rsquo;s buff the French ran into our vanguard.</p></div> </div>
