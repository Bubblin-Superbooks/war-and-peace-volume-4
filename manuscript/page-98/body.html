<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sónya&rsquo;s letter written from Tróitsa, which had come as an answer to Nicholas&rsquo; prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess&rsquo; mind more and more. She knew that Sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and Sónya&rsquo;s life in the countess&rsquo; house had grown harder and harder, especially after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Boguchárovo. The countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sónya.</p><p>But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that was going on, she called Sónya to her and, instead of reproaching and making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with Nicholas.</p></div> </div>
