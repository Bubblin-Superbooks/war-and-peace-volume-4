<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Battle of Borodin√≥, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the most instructive phenomena in history.</p><p>All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases.</p><p>Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor, having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy&rsquo;s army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation&mdash;</p></div> </div>
