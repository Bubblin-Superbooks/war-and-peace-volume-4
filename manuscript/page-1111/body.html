<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded&mdash;as the result of the free, or as the result of the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.</p><p>Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge&mdash;thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed matter&mdash;has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of so-called advanced people&mdash;that is, the crowd of ignoramuses&mdash;have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.</p></div> </div>
