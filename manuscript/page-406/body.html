<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kut√∫zov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules&mdash;as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on&mdash;the cudgel of the people&rsquo;s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting anyone&rsquo;s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had perished.</p></div> </div>
