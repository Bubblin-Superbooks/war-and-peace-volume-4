<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into Smolénsk.</p><p>Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denís Davýdov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare.</p><p>On August 24 Davýdov&rsquo;s first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became.</p></div> </div>
