<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;so that it even becomes absurd.&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk, especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband. Natásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting.</p></div> </div>
