What is his general condition?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You, you... will see,&rdquo; was all Natásha could say.</p><p>They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.</p><p>&ldquo;How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When did this happen?&rdquo; Princess Mary inquired.</p><p>Natásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Tróitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also passed. When they reached Yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester (Natásha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.</p></div> </div>
