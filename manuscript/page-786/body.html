<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of a headache began to say good night.</p><p>&ldquo;So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I am not going,&rdquo; Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as though offended. &ldquo;Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,&rdquo; said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking his departure.</p><p>Nat√°sha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.</p></div> </div>
