<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> General Bagov√∫t, a fighting old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody&rsquo;s surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll.</p><p>&ldquo;I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as well as anybody,&rdquo; he said, and advanced with a single division.</p><p>Coming out onto a field under the enemy&rsquo;s fire, this brave general went straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly.</p></div> </div>
