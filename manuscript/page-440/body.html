Their un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Bwing the prisoner here,&rdquo; said Denísov in a low voice, not taking his eyes off the French.</p><p>A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Denísov. Pointing to the French troops, Denísov asked him what these and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denísov in affright, but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely assenting to everything Denísov asked him. Denísov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.</p></div> </div>
