<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But the once proud and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power.</p><p>Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power. Chance puts the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him&mdash;thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.</p></div> </div>
