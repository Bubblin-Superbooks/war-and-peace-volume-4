After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas&mdash;having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the friendliest terms&mdash;galloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor&rsquo;s party.</p></div> </div>
