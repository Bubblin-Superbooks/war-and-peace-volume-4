<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nat치sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of Nicholas&rsquo; circumstances. Having borrowed money from his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him. His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and S칩nya, but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Nat치sha or S칩nya, or for Nicholas himself.</p></div> </div>
