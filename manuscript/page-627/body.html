<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon&mdash;that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed human dignity&mdash;Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he is grand. But Kutúzov&mdash;the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodinó to Vílna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening&mdash;Kutúzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed.</p><p>And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people.</p></div> </div>
