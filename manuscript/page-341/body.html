What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And smeared with something!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...&rdquo; the convoy guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence, drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man.</p></div> </div>
