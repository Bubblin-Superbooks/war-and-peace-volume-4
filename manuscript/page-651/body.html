<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....&rdquo;</p><p>Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden. &ldquo;There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I&rsquo;ll give it to you!&rdquo; shouted he, hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make less noise?&rdquo;</p><p>The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle.</p></div> </div>
