<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though the French had offered to move him from the men&rsquo;s to the officers&rsquo; shed, he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.</p><p>In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Borodin√≥.</p></div> </div>
