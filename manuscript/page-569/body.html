<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n&rsquo;y a qu&rsquo;un pas,&rdquo; * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been repeating: &ldquo;Sublime! Grand! Napol√©on le Grand!&rdquo; Du sublime au ridicule il n&rsquo;y a qu&rsquo;un pas.</p><p>And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one&rsquo;s own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.</p><p>For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent.</p></div> </div>
