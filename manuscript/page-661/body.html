<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Eh? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense!&rdquo; said a sergeant major.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to be doing the same?&rdquo; said an old soldier, turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the fire, &ldquo;a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it&rsquo;s death. Take me, now! I&rsquo;ve got no strength left,&rdquo; he added, with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major. &ldquo;Tell them to send me to hospital; I&rsquo;m aching all over; anyway I shan&rsquo;t be able to keep up.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
