From reports current in town she learned how the Rostóvs were situated, and how &ldquo;the son has sacrificed himself for his mother,&rdquo; as people were saying.</p><p>&ldquo;I never expected anything else of him,&rdquo; said Princess Mary to herself, feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly relations with all the Rostóvs which had made her almost a member of the family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her relations with Nicholas in Vorónezh she was shy about doing so. Making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow.</p></div> </div>
