<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, all together&mdash;shove!&rdquo; cried the voices, and the huge surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That&rsquo;s it.... Where are you shoving to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
