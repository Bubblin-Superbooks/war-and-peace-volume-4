<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man&rsquo;s whole outlook on the universe is constructed&mdash;the incomprehensible essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.</p><p>Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end.</p><p>Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me, consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living, consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.</p></div> </div>
