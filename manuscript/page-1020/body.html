<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs.</p><p>Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.</p><p>It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man&rsquo;s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them in practice.</p><p>Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses.</p></div> </div>
