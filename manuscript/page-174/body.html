She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and no difficulties daunted her.

Her love for Rost칩v no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer struggled against it.

She had become convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the Rost칩vs.</p></div> </div>
