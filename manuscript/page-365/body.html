<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovítinov reached Litashëvka after one o&rsquo;clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered a dark passage.</p><p>&ldquo;The general on duty, quick! It&rsquo;s very important!&rdquo; said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.</p><p>&ldquo;He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept,&rdquo; said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. &ldquo;You should wake the captain first.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
