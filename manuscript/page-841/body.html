<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.</p><p>This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.</p><p>That act is performed.</p><p>The last r√¥le is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.</p><p>And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions.</p></div> </div>
