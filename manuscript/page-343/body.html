<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Through the cross streets of the Khamóvniki quarter the prisoners marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles.</p><p>At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them. To the right, where the Kalúga road turns near Neskúchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais&rsquo; corps which had started before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were Ney&rsquo;s troops and transport.</p></div> </div>
