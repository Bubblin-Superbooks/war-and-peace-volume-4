It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, are you a soldier then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we are soldiers of the Ápsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We weren&rsquo;t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had no idea, never guessed at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And do you feel sad here?&rdquo; Pierre inquired.</p><p>&ldquo;How can one help it, lad? My name is Platón, and the surname is Karatáev,&rdquo; he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to address him. &ldquo;They call me &lsquo;little falcon&rsquo; in the regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? Moscow&mdash;she&rsquo;s the mother of cities.</p></div> </div>
