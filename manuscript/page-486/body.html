Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a hard nut to crack,&rdquo; said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make them get a move on, those fellows!&rdquo; said another, laughing.</p></div> </div>
