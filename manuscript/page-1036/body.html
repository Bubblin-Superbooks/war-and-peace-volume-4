<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon&rsquo;s misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon&rsquo;s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age produced Napoleon&rsquo;s power. But Napoleon&rsquo;s power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age.</p><p>This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at every step, but the universal historians&rsquo; accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.</p></div> </div>
