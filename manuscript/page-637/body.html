<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of Krásnoe. Toward evening&mdash;after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders&mdash;when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle, Kutúzov left Krásnoe and went to Dóbroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred.</p><p>The day was clear and frosty. Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires.</p></div> </div>
