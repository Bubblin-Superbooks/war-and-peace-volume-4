<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man&rsquo;s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed &ldquo;power.&rdquo;</p><p>A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.</p><p>Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question: why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he ordered was done.</p></div> </div>
