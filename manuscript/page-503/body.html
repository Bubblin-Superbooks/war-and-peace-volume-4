<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.</p><p>He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Pétya&rsquo;s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.</p></div> </div>
