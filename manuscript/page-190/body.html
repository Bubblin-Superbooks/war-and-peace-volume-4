<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Natásha opened Prince Andrew&rsquo;s door with a familiar movement and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears.</p><p>The princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words: &ldquo;two days ago this suddenly happened.&rdquo; She understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination Andrew&rsquo;s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore affected her very strongly.</p></div> </div>
