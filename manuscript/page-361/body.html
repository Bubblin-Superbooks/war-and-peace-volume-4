At that time Dokhtúrov had under his command, besides Dórokhov&rsquo;s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslávin.</p><p>On the evening of October 11 Seslávin came to the Aristóvo headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the troops that had entered Formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days previously.</p></div> </div>
