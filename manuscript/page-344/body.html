<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Davout&rsquo;s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kalúga road. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais&rsquo; train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kalúga road when the vanguard of Ney&rsquo;s army was already emerging from the Great Ordýnka Street.</p><p>When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kalúga road, taking more than an hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the Transmoskvá ward and the Kalúga road converge, and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway.</p></div> </div>
