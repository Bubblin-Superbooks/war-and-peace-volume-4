He paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now smiling happily.</p><p>He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nat√°sha, and of their love, at one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.

Evidently it has to be so,&rdquo; said he to himself, and hastily undressing he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision.</p></div> </div>
