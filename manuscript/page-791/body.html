No, it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I&rsquo;ll go. But I may come again tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat√°sha was less animated than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. &ldquo;Is it possible? No, it can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy.</p></div> </div>
