<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not that Natásha liked solitude&mdash;she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought that she did not&mdash;but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing of her children, and sharing every moment of her husband&rsquo;s life, she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society. All who had known Natásha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all Natásha&rsquo;s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband&mdash;as she herself had once exclaimed at Otrádnoe not so much in fun as in earnest&mdash;and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood Natásha, and she kept saying that she had always known that Natásha would make an exemplary wife and mother.</p></div> </div>
