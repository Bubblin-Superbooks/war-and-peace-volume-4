How did this happen?&rdquo; She wished to express this doubt to him. &ldquo;Now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others?&rdquo; she asked herself, and passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as Platón Karatáev.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what I am thinking about?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;About Platón Karatáev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
