<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirgh√≠z mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue French overcoat.</p><p>Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.</p><p>Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. Steam rose from them.</p></div> </div>
