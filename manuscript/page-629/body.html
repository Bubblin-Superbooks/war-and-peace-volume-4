<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When Count Rostopchín at the Yaúza bridge galloped up to Kutúzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: &ldquo;How was it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle?&rdquo; Kutúzov replied: &ldquo;And I shall not abandon Moscow without a battle,&rdquo; though Moscow was then already abandoned. When Arakchéev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that Ermólov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutúzov replied: &ldquo;Yes, I was just saying so myself,&rdquo; though a moment before he had said quite the contrary. What did it matter to him&mdash;who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening&mdash;what did it matter to him whether Rostopchín attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.</p></div> </div>
