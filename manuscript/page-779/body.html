<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How easy he thinks it,&rdquo; thought Pierre. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know how terrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?&rdquo; asked Savélich.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll put it off for a bit. I&rsquo;ll tell you later. You must forgive the trouble I have put you to,&rdquo; said Pierre, and seeing Savélich smile, he thought: &ldquo;But how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?&rdquo; Pierre reflected. &ldquo;No, another time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
