<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Father, he says, &lsquo;All my children are the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if Plat√≥n hadn&rsquo;t been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.&rsquo; called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons. &lsquo;Michael,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before him! Do you understand?&rsquo; he says. That&rsquo;s how it is, dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not well&mdash;that&rsquo;s not right!&rsquo; Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it bulges, but when you&rsquo;ve drawn it out it&rsquo;s empty! That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
