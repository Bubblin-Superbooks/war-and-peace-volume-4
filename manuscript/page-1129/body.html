<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company, a drunkard&rsquo;s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause. If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton&mdash;then, knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result.</p><p>On these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes.</p></div> </div>
