As if I don&rsquo;t know what sort you want!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a bwute you are!... Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went for another one,&rdquo; Tíkhon continued, &ldquo;and I crept like this through the wood and lay down.&rdquo; (He suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) &ldquo;One turned up and I grabbed him, like this.&rdquo; (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) &ldquo;&lsquo;Come along to the colonel,&rsquo; I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords.</p></div> </div>
