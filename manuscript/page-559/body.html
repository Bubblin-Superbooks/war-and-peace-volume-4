<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian blindman&rsquo;s bluff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>At first while they were still moving along the Kalúga road, Napoleon&rsquo;s armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the Smolénsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight&mdash;and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.</p></div> </div>
