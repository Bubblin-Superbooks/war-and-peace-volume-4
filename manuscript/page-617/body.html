The only difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon&rsquo;s army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army.</p></div> </div>
