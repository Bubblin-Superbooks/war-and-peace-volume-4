<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation.</p><p>The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire&mdash;namely, as something existing absolutely. But for history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.</p><p>From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power&mdash;existing immutably outside time&mdash;is, but to history&rsquo;s questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing.</p></div> </div>
