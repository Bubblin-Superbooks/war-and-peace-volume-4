<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military historians (to the effect that Kutúzov hindered an attack) is unfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at Vyázma and Tarútino.</p><p>Why was the Russian army&mdash;which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at Borodinó&mdash;defeated at Krásnoe and the Berëzina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically superior?</p><p>If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his marshals&mdash;and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled&mdash;then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian historians.</p></div> </div>
