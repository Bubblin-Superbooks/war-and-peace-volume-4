<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Nat√°sha. They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams;</p></div> </div>
