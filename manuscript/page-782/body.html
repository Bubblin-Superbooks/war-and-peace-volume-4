<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day.</p><p>&ldquo;And this man too,&rdquo; thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief of Police. &ldquo;What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn&rsquo;t he take bribes? That&rsquo;s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
