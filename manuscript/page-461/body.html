<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send somebody to Denísov&rsquo;s detachment, Pétya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled Pétya&rsquo;s mad action at the battle of Vyázma, where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of Denísov&rsquo;s. That was why Pétya had blushed and grown confused when Denísov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest Pétya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once.</p></div> </div>
