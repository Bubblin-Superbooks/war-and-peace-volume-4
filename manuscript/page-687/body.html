<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs&mdash;this same Kut√∫zov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereign&rsquo;s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and heir&mdash;apparent from the army&mdash;who on his own authority and contrary to the Emperor&rsquo;s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest.</p></div> </div>
