One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off an army&mdash;to bar its road&mdash;is quite impossible, for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of Krásnoe and of the Berëzina. It is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one&rsquo;s hand. Men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics, as the Germans did.</p></div> </div>
