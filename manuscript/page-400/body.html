<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army&mdash;a hundredth part of a nation&mdash;should oblige that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.</p><p>So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon&rsquo;s wars serve to confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerst√§dt destroy the independent existence of Prussia.</p></div> </div>
