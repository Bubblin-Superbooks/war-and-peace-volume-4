<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These three groups traveling together&mdash;the cavalry stores, the convoy of prisoners, and Junot&rsquo;s baggage train&mdash;still constituted a separate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.</p><p>Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been captured or left behind. Some of Junot&rsquo;s wagons also had been captured or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from Davout&rsquo;s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been shot by the marshal&rsquo;s own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession.</p></div> </div>
