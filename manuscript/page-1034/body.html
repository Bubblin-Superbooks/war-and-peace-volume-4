<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon&rsquo;s power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians of this class, by mutually destroying one another&rsquo;s positions, destroy the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no reply to history&rsquo;s essential question.</p><p>Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians&rsquo; view of the force which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces.</p></div> </div>
