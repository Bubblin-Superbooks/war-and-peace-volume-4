<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having returned to the watchman&rsquo;s hut, Pétya found Denísov in the passage. He was awaiting Pétya&rsquo;s return in a state of agitation, anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Yes, thank God!&rdquo; he repeated, listening to Pétya&rsquo;s rapturous account. &ldquo;But, devil take you, I haven&rsquo;t slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But... no,&rdquo; said Pétya, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sleep yet. Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep it&rsquo;s finished. And then I am used to not sleeping before a battle.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
