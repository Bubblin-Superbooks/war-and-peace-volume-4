<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the eighth of September an officer&mdash;a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him&mdash;entered the coach house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming Pierre as &ldquo;the man who does not give his name.&rdquo; Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin&rsquo;s Field. It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the ZÃºbovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns.</p></div> </div>
