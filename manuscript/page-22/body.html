This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country&rsquo;s weal, is offered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What force! What a style!&rdquo; was uttered in approval both of reader and of author.</p></div> </div>
