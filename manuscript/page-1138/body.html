<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we never reach absolute inevitability.</p><p>But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case&mdash;as for instance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot&mdash;complete absence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man&rsquo;s completely free action.</p></div> </div>
