<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezúkhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way.</p><p>They all knew very well that the enchanting countess&rsquo; illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time, and that the Italian&rsquo;s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience; but in Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it.</p></div> </div>
