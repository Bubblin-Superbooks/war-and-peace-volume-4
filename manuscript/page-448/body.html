That wound (which Tíkhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment&mdash;jokes in which Tíkhon readily joined.</p><p>&ldquo;Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?&rdquo; the Cossacks would banter him. And Tíkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect of this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners.</p></div> </div>
