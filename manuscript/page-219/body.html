Natásha went up, looked at the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him&mdash;his body.</p><p>&ldquo;Where has he gone? Where is he now?...&rdquo;</p><p>When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table, everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.</p><p>Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity. The countess and Sónya cried from pity for Natásha and because he was no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.</p></div> </div>
