I only say that I&rsquo;ll certainly go with you,&rdquo; said Pétya shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;But for you and me, old fellow, it&rsquo;s time to drop these amenities,&rdquo; continued Dólokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated Denísov. &ldquo;Now, why have you kept this lad?&rdquo; he went on, swaying his head. &ldquo;Because you are sorry for him! Don&rsquo;t we know those &lsquo;receipts&rsquo; of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed.
