<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In reality in all Napoleon&rsquo;s activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon&rsquo;s one series, for the campaign of 1812, was carried out&mdash;not because those orders differed in any way from the other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil.</p></div> </div>
