It was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre interrupted her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just imagine&mdash;I knew nothing about him!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thought he had been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that he fell in with the Rost√≥vs.... What a strange coincidence!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation.
