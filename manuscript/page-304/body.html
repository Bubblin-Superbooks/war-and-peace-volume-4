<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging&mdash;October 9.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force&mdash;October 11.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to the Kr√©mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
