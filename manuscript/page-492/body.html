At one spot he stopped and listened. &ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; he asked. Pétya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires. When they had descended to the bridge Pétya and Dólokhov rode past the sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, good-by.
