<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others.</p><p>For instance, Pierre&rsquo;s return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so.</p><p>The servants&mdash;the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life&mdash;were glad of Pierre&rsquo;s return because they knew that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.</p></div> </div>
