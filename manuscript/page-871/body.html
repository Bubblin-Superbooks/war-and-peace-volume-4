Yes, were it not for that...&rdquo; And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.</p><p>&ldquo;But why, Count, why?&rdquo; she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to him. &ldquo;Why? Tell me. You must tell me!&rdquo;</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your why, Count,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s hard for me... I confess it.

And that hurts me.&rdquo; There were tears in her eyes and in her voice. &ldquo;I have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear....
