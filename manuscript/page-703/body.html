After his liberation he reached OrÃ«l, and on the third day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up for three months. He had what the doctors termed &ldquo;bilious fever.&rdquo; But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.</p><p>Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre&rsquo;s mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness.
