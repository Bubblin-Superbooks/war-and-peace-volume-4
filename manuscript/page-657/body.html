Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, Mak√©ev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!&rdquo; shouted a red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. &ldquo;And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!&rdquo; said he to another soldier.</p><p>This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself.
