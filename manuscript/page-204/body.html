<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life&mdash;was now near to him and, by the strange lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....</p><p>Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death&mdash;the end&mdash;but now he no longer understood that fear.</p><p>He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and knew that he was face to face with death.</p></div> </div>
