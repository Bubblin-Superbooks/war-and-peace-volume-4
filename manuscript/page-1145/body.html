But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics.</p><p>In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force.</p></div> </div>
