<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One told how he had taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: &lsquo;What are you being punished for, Daddy?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I, my dear brothers,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;am being punished for my own and other men&rsquo;s sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much property. &lsquo;And he went on to tell them all about it in due order. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t grieve for myself,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,&rsquo; and the old man began to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant. &lsquo;Where did it happen, Daddy?&rsquo; he said.</p></div> </div>
