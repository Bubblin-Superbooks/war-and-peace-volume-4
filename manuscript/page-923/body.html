<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family&mdash;that is, one wife or one husband. Natásha needed a husband. A husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different.</p><p>Natásha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the society of her relatives&mdash;Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and Sónya.</p></div> </div>
