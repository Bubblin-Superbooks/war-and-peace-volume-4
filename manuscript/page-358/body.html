<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhtúrov&mdash;that same modest little Dokhtúrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning&mdash;but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolénsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon&rsquo;s whole army.</p></div> </div>
