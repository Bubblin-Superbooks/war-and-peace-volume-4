<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one&rsquo;s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one&rsquo;s occupation, that is, of one&rsquo;s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man&rsquo;s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice.</p></div> </div>
