The man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to D贸lokhov&rsquo;s horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the landowner&rsquo;s house.</p></div> </div>
