<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon&rsquo;s having been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for France.</p><p>It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers&rsquo; pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor&rsquo;s birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made in Kutúzov&rsquo;s report of the Russian losses, among which figured the names of Túchkov, Bagratión, and Kutáysov.</p></div> </div>
