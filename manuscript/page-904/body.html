<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mary, dear, I think he is asleep&mdash;he was so tired,&rdquo; said S贸nya, meeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she crossed her path everywhere). &ldquo;Andrew may wake him.&rdquo;</p><p>Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that S贸nya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but to avoid obeying S贸nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door. S贸nya went away by another door. From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept.</p></div> </div>
