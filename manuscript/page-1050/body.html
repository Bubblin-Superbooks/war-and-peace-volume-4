<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and such histories as Thiers&rsquo; will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?&mdash;that is, wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension.</p><p>The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold.</p></div> </div>
