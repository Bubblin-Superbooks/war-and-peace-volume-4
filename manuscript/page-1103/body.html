<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.</p><p>The presence of the problem of man&rsquo;s free will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step of history.</p><p>All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question.</p></div> </div>
