<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The battle of Tarútino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in view&mdash;to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions; nor that which Count Orlóv-Denísov may have had in view&mdash;to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the Russians of that day desired&mdash;to drive the French out of Russia and destroy their army&mdash;it is quite clear that the battle of Tarútino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign.</p></div> </div>
