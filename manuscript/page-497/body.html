Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats. In the dark Pétya recognized his own horse, which he called &ldquo;Karabákh&rdquo; though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Karabákh! We&rsquo;ll do some service tomorrow,&rdquo; said he, sniffing its nostrils and kissing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you asleep, sir?&rdquo; said a Cossack who was sitting under a wagon.</p><p>&ldquo;No, ah... Likhachëv&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that your name? Do you know I have only just come back! We&rsquo;ve been into the French camp.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
