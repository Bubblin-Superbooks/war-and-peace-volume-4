<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation&rsquo;s progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not to mention the historians&rsquo; contradictions as to the nature of this program&mdash;or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists&mdash;the facts of history almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iv√°n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV&rsquo;s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI.</p></div> </div>
