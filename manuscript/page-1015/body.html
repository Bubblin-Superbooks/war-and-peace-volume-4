<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) &ldquo;My father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarch&rsquo;s men, and I will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me, and be delighted with me!&rdquo; And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry.</p></div> </div>
