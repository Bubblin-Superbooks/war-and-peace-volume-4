<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful. If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the preservation of my father&rsquo;s house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called &ldquo;progress&rdquo; appear to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me.</p></div> </div>
