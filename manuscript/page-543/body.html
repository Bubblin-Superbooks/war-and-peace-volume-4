<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the expression on their faces&mdash;one of them glanced timidly at Pierre&mdash;there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.</p><p>Behind him, where Karat√°ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl. &ldquo;What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?&rdquo; thought Pierre.</p><p>His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.</p></div> </div>
