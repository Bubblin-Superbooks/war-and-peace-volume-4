<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostóvs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal founders.</p><p>On reading that letter (she always read her husband&rsquo;s letters) Natásha herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all her husband&rsquo;s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters. To Pierre&rsquo;s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return. He was given four weeks&rsquo; leave of absence.</p></div> </div>
