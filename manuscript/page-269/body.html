Orlóv-Denísov, still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.</p><p>Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that &ldquo;the First Column will march&rdquo; and so on, the infantry of the belated columns, commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward, simply to get somewhere.</p></div> </div>
