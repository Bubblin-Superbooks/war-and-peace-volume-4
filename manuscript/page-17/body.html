Oh, that&rsquo;s a terrible illness!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...&rdquo; and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are speaking of the poor countess?&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, coming up just then. &ldquo;I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better.
