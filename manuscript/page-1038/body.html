That Chateaubriand, Madame de Staël, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted&mdash;that is, how component forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A&mdash;the historian is again obliged to fall back on power&mdash;the force he had denied&mdash;and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant.</p></div> </div>
