<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the watchman&rsquo;s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, LikhachÃ«v, who was sitting under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished&mdash;disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.</p></div> </div>
