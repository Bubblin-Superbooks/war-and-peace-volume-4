Someone snored.</p><p>&ldquo;Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...&rdquo; hissed the saber against the whetstone, and suddenly Pétya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. Pétya was as musical as Natásha and more so than Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was a fugue&mdash;though Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is. Each instrument&mdash;now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and clearer than violin or horn&mdash;</p></div> </div>
