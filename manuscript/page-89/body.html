A real angel!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sónya?&rdquo; And he involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other&mdash;a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture presented itself to his mind.</p></div> </div>
