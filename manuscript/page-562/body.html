<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Seeing their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate portions of the French army&mdash;first Murat&rsquo;s (the vice-king&rsquo;s), then Davout&rsquo;s, and then Ney&rsquo;s&mdash;ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.</p><p>Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of Smol√©nsk which were in nobody&rsquo;s way, because despite the unfortunate plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves.</p></div> </div>
