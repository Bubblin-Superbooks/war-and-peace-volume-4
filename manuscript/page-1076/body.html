<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand.</p><p>If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning, then having subjected to criticism the explanation of &ldquo;power&rdquo; that juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon.</p></div> </div>
