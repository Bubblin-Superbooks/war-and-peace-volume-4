What a nuisance it is!&rdquo; thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man said he had seen Ermólov ride past with some other generals, others said he must have returned home. The officer searched till six o&rsquo;clock in the evening without even stopping to eat. Ermólov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at a comrade&rsquo;s, and rode again to the vanguard to find Milorádovich.</p></div> </div>
