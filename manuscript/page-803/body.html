<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The change that took place in Nat치sha at first surprised Princess Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. &ldquo;Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?&rdquo; she thought when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Nat치sha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Nat치sha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart.</p><p>Nat치sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright and cheerful.</p></div> </div>
